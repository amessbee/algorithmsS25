% Questions from q4.tex
\begin{p}
Given an undirected graph with distinct non-negative edge weights. Suppose that you have computed shortest paths to all nodes from a particular node \( s \). Now suppose each edge weight is increased by 1; the new weights are \( w_e := w_e + 1 \). Do the shortest paths change? Give an example where they change or prove they cannot change.
\hfill \end{p}

\begin{p} 
Give a general example of a weighted, directed graph \( G \) on \( n \) nodes where at least half of the edge weights are negative, and Dijkstra's algorithm correctly finds the shortest paths from a source vertex. Note that \( n \) is not fixed, so you cannot just give an example on 10 or 20 vertices. Your job is to maximize the number of edges that contain negative weights.

\begin{p}
"In GoldExtractor game, you collect coins using two extractors: a red vertical one that moves right and a blue horizontal one that moves up. Each time an extractor moves to a new line containing coins, it collects one coin, and all other coins on that line are lost. The game ends when either extractor reaches its final position, so plan your moves carefully to maximize your total score!"

Design a complete Dynamic Programming algorithm for the problem. Your input is (x,y) coordinates of n coins, and your output is a number which is maximum number of coins collected. You can assume that $0 < x,y < n$.

Solve the following recurrence relations:\\
\vspace{10pt}
\textbf{a.} \( T(n) = 2T(n/3) + 1 \)\\
\textbf{b.} \( T(n) = 5T(n/4) + n \)\\
\textbf{c.} \( T(n) = 9T(n/3) + n^2 \)\\

\textbf{e.} \( T(n) = T(\sqrt{n}) + 1 \)\\
\hfill \end{p}

\begin{p}
An array \( A[1 \dots n] \) is said to have a \textbf{majority element} if more than half of its entries are the same. Given an array, the task is to design an efficient algorithm to determine whether the array has a majority element, and, if so, to find that element. The elements of the array are not necessarily from some ordered domain like the integers, so comparisons of the form "is \( A[i] > A[j]? \)" are not allowed. (Think of the array elements as GIF files, for instance.) However, you can answer questions of the form: "is \( A[i] = A[j]? \)" in constant time.\\
\vspace{10pt}
\textbf{Part 1:} Show how to solve this problem in \( O(n \log n) \) time. 
\textbf{Hint:} Split the array \( A \) into two arrays \( A_1 \) and \( A_2 \) of half the size. Does knowing the majority elements of \( A_1 \) and \( A_2 \) help you figure out the majority element of \( A \)? If so, you can use a \textit{divide-and-conquer} approach.\\
\vspace{10pt}
\textbf{Part 2:} Can you give a linear-time algorithm? 
\textbf{Hint:} Here's another \textit{divide-and-conquer} approach:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Pair up the elements of \( A \) arbitrarily to get \( n/2 \) pairs.
    \item Look at each pair: if the two elements are different, discard both of them; if they are the same, keep just one of them.
\end{itemize}
Show that after this procedure there are at most \( n/2 \) elements left, and that they have a majority element if and only if \( A \) does.
\hfill \end{p}

    \item When \( A \) and \( B \) are unsorted.

% Questions from w3.tex
\begin{p}
Give an \( O(n \log k) \)-time algorithm to merge \( k \) sorted lists into one sorted list,  
where \( n \) is the total number of elements in all the input lists. (Hint: Use a min-heap for \( k \)-way merging.)
\hfill \end{p}

\begin{p}
You are given an array of strings, where different strings may have different  
numbers of characters, but the total number of characters over all the strings  
is \( n \). Show how to sort the strings in \( O(n) \) time.  
(Note that the desired order here is the standard alphabetical order; for example,  
\( a < ab < b \).)
\hfill \end{p}

% Questions from w4.tex
\begin{p}
What is the running time of the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm if we represent its input graph using an adjacency matrix and modify the algorithm to handle this form of input?
\hfill \end{p}

\begin{p}
The \textbf{diameter} of a tree \( T = (V, F) \) is defined as \( \max \{ \delta(u, v) : u, v \in V \} \), that is, the largest of all shortest-path distances in the tree. Give an efficient algorithm to compute the diameter of a tree, and analyze the running time of your algorithm.
\hfill \end{p}

For each of the following strings:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
